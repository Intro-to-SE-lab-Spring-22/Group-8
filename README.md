# Project Description:
  
  Spyke is a new, web based social media platform, designed to share our users stories with the world. Spyke will show the users different feeds from topics they enjoy, such as sports, food, politics, humor, and much more. Future plans for spike include adding tags for users to add to their posts, these tags will help filter and show individualised feeds to our users. To make sure our users are safe, we will be implementing various cyber security tools and assets to ensure that the user's data stays safe. We are also implementing a timeline feature to accurately date posts and keep users informed on current events.
